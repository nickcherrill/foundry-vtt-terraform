# Discontinued
I realised during this deployment that Azure wouldn't provide DevOps build agents without a Â£40/month fee, so I've copied the code from my DevOps project to GitHub and consider this archived.
Perhaps someone else with access to a free account, or if the pricing changes, could use this to deploy Foundry VTT in the future, using Azure.
